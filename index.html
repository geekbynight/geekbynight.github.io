    <p>The data of this line plots is sourced from the dataset that details projects and associated costs that were commisioned by the US Government, the X Axis represents the time, the Y Axis represents the lifecycle cost of projects, which are grouped by different departments of the government. From the visualisation we can see that from 2000~2001, the Department of Defense started taking up a large part of the total spendign of US government, and the Department of Agriculture and the Department of State had some huge-spending projects from 2010.</p>

      <p>This plots provides information to numerous audiences on the governmentâ€™s costs for the past 20 years. The taxpayer of this government could have access to know how the government spend the tax. For people who work for journalism, the increase or decrease of the costs spending on some departments shows them the change of the policies. For example, the Department of Defense had a tremendors increase in their costs from 2000~2005, which could be related to "911" terrorist attack.
